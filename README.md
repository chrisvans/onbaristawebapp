===============

Web App for Baristas to check in when they are on bar at their cafe.
Customers can check to see when their favorite barista is making drinks.

For those who want a peek at the latest alpha version check out http://acoats.myds.me:9867/

This currently is running off of a Raspberry Pi for testing purposes, so it may be slow at times.

This App uses Python 2.7.3, Django 1.4.3, and South 0.7.6.

App Use-

After registering, you will be presented with the main page, containing the companies
that are currently registered in the app.  Future functionality will allow users to
register companies, once a verification system is in place.  In the upper right section
of the page is your profile, which you can click on to set your profile image, favorite
company ( shows up first on the home page ), favorite barista ( shows up on the bottom
lane, tells you whether or not they are checked in, and where ), and other information.
From the main page, you can select a company to view, and then see who is currently
checked in.  This is not a beta version yet, so none of the information is real.  
If you are a barista, you can check out the barista tab, where you can register as
a barista.  This will allow you to check in/check out at a location.
